Potions
---------------

This modpack adds a simple potion brewing system for Minetest Game, balanced for and tested in v7 world generation.
The brewing system is designed to provide a use for lesser used materials (especially tin and gold),
and to encourage base-building due to the relatively large amount of space a proper brewing room can require.

Custom potions can be added using the api (see API.md).
For further details (including a list of all potions and their effects) see the guide.txt file.

The potions functionality is split into 3 mods, for more dependecy options:

* potions_api (api) - provides the API for defining potion types
* potions_brewing (brewing) - adds the alchemy stand and the brewing system
* potions_default (potions) - adds a complete set of potions
